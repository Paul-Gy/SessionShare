## Why ?

When working with several people, it is often necessary to send files to each other. There are many services to send a
single file, but I haven't found one that allows you to send several files in several times without having to send a new
link each time.

## Features

* Use a single link to share multiple files in multiples times
* End-to-end AES-256-GCM files encryption support
* Blazing fast thanks to Cloudflare Workers
* Uploaded/deleted files are instantly visible by everyone in the session

## Planned features

* Support for larger files using multipart upload (currently limited to 100 MB)
